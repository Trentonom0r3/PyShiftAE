# Current Progress

- Embedded Python 3.11 Interpreter, able to use numpy and other libs.
- Implemented basic version of 'App' and 'Project' classes.
- Usage is the same as extendscript "app.project, app.project.name, app.version, app.executeCommand(cmdID)"
- Implemented basic version of 'Item' Class.
  
## TODO

- Ensure everything works as properly in its basic state, then continue expanding the library.

- After the library is to a decent size, write python stub files for pip install, so the user can easily write their python scripts in an IDE.

- Finally, implement a method akin to 'csinterface.evalscript()' to provide an interface for CEP extension to use.

- Eventually, add some way to control scripting without AE being open, and from scripts running in cmd prompt.
